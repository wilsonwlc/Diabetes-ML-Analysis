# Algorithm
## Notation
- $T$: whole training set
- $pnum$: number of minority instances
- $nnum$: number of majority instances
- $P=\{p_{1}, p_{2},..., p_{pnum}\}$: set of minority class 
- $N=\{ n_{1}, n_{2},..., n_{nnum} \}$: set of majority class
## Step
1. For every $p_{i}$ in $P$,  calculate its $m$ nearest neighbours from $T$. Denote the number of majority instances among $m$ nearest neighbours by $m'$.
	-  $0 \leq m' \leq m$. 
	- $m'$ and $m$ depend on $i$
2. Categorise each minority instance $p_{i}$ into 3 groups by the following criteria
	1. If $m'=m$, all $m$ nearest neighbours of $p_{i}$ are majority instances *i.e.* $p_{i}$ is surrounded by majority instances only. $p_{i}$ should be included in the set $\text{NOISE}$ and not be operated in the following steps.
	2. If $\frac{m}{2} \leq m' \leq m$, more than half of $m$ nearest neighbours are majority instances *i.e.* $p_{i}$ is surrounded by more majority nearest neighbours than minority ones. Hence, this $p_{i}$ should be included in the set $\text{DANGER}$ because it can be misclassified easily
		- $\text{DANGER} \subseteq P$ 
		- Denote $\text{DANGER}=\{p'_{1}, p'_{2},..., p'_{dnum}\}$ where $0 \leq dnum \leq pnum$. 
	3. If $0 \leq m' \leq \frac{m}{2}$, $p_{i}$ will be considered in the set $\text{SAFE}$ and not operated in the following steps
3. For each instance in $\text{DANGER}$, calculate its $k$ nearest neighbours from $P$
4. For each $p'_{i}$ in $\text{DANGER}$, randomly select $s \in \{1,2,...,k\}$ nearest neighbours from its $k$ nearest neighbours in $P$. Perform the following procedure which is similar to the regular SMOTE algorithm *i.e.* For each $j \in \{1,2,...,s\}$
	1. Calculate the difference between $p'_{i}$ and its $s$ nearest neighbours from $P$ $$dif_{j}$$
	2. Multiply the difference by a random number $r_{j} \sim U(0,1)$
	3. Create a synthetic instance $$synthetic_{j} = p'_{i}+r_{j} \times dif_{j}$$
5. After Step 4, in total, $s \times dnum$ synthetic minority instances are generated from the instances in set $\text{DANGER}$
